## 10. Principle Component Analysis
A random forest is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve classification and regression problems. 
It uses ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines many classifiers to provide solutions to complex problems.
A random forest algorithm consists of many decision trees. 

Random forest is a popular machine learning algorithm due to its: High accuracy, Robustness, Feature importance, Versatility, Scalability. 
Random forest reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees and is less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data.
