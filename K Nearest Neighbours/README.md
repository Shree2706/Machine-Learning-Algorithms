## 5. K Nearest Neighbours(KNN)

KNN stands for "K-Nearest Neighbor". It's a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. 

The KNN algorithm predicts the label or value of a new data point by considering its K closest neighbors in the training dataset. The symbol 'K' denotes
the number of nearest neighbors to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified. 

The KNN algorithm is easy to implement and understand. However, it has a major drawback of becoming significantly slower as the size of the data in use grows.

### Other disadvantages include: 
1. It is quite computationally inefficient
2. It's difficult to pick the “correct” value of K
   
### Advantages of the KNN algorithm include: 
It is versatile to different calculations of proximity
It's very intuitive
It's a memory based approach
