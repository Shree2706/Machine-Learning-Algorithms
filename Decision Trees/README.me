## 8. Decision Trees
A decision tree is a flow chart created by a computer algorithm to make decisions or numeric predictions based on information in a digital data set.
It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning. 

A decision tree is a tree-like structure where each internal node tests on attribute, each branch corresponds to attribute value, and each leaf node
represents a decision. 

Decision trees are used for classification and regression modeling. Regression is a method used for predictive modeling, so these trees are used to
either classify data or predict what will come next.
