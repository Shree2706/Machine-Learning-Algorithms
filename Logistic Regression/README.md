## 3. Logistic Regresssion -

Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict
the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class. It is used for classification algorithms its name is logistic regression. itâ€™s referred to as 
regression because it takes the output of the linear regression function as input and uses a sigmoid function to estimate the probability for the given class. 


The difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear regression output is the continuous value that can be anything while logistic 
regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not.
