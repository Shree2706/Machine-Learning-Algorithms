## 1. Linear Regression Algorithm
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent
variable and one or more independent features. The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the
value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. The equation provides a straight line that represents the 
relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
There are Three types of Linear Regression:
 1. Simple Linear Regression - Simple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent
    variable and one dependent variable using a straight line.
2. Multiple Linear Regression - Multiple linear regression (MLR) is used to determine a mathematical relationship among several random
   variables.1 In other terms, MLR examines how multiple independent variables are related to one dependent variable.
3. Polynomial Linear Regression - A polynomial regression model is a machine learning model that can capture non-linear relationships
    between variables by fitting a non-linear regression line, which may not be possible with simple linear regression.
    It is used when linear regression models may not adequately capture the complexity of the relationship.
