## 11. K Means Clustering
K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm in machine learning that groups unlabeled data into different clusters.
The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. For example,
if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters. 

K-means clustering is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The algorithm performs the
division of objects into clusters that share similarities and are dissimilar to the objects belonging to another cluster.

## 12. Heirarchial Clustering
In hierarchical clustering, data points that are close together are assumed to be more similar or related than data points that are
farther apart. The algorithm builds clusters by measuring the dissimilarities between data. 

The hierarchy of clusters is developed in the form of a tree, known as the dendrogram. The root node corresponds to the entire data,
and branches are created from the root node to form several clusters.

## 13. DBSCAN clustering
DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. It is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that finds
clusters in data by grouping data points that are closely packed together. DBSCAN is useful for identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and
for detecting noise in the data. 

The main idea behind DBSCAN is that a point belongs to a cluster if it is close to many points from that cluster. DBSCAN works on the
assumption that clusters are dense regions in space separated by regions of lower density. It groups "densely grouped" data points into
a single cluster.
