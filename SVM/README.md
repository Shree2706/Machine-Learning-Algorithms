## 4. Support Vector Machines(SVM)

A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning to solve classification, regression, and outlier detection problems. SVMs are particularly good at solving binary classification problems, which require classifying the elements of a data set into two groups. 
SVMs can be used for a variety of tasks, such as: Text classification, Image classification, Spam detection, Handwriting identification. 

### SVMs have two key properties: 
1. They find solutions of classification problems that have "generalization in mind".
2. They are able to find non-linear solutions efficiently using the "kernel trick".


SVMs are effective in high dimensional spaces and in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
